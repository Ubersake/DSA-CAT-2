Big O notation is a mathematical notation that is used to give an upper bound on an algorithm's time or space complexity as a function of the input size. It provides a way to measure the relative performance of algorithms, particularly for very large inputs. Here are some basic principles of Big O notation, along with examples:

1. Constant Time - O(1)
An algorithm is said to have constant time complexity if the time it takes to execute is not dependent on the input size.

Example: Retrieving an element from an array using index:

public class ArrayUtils {
    public static int getElement(int[] array, int index) {
        return array[index];
    }
}

2. Linear Time - O(n)
An algorithm has linear time complexity when the time of execution increases with the input size.

Example: Finding an element in an unordered list:

public class ArrayUtils {
    public static boolean findElement(int[] array, int target) {
        for (int element : array) {
            if (element == target) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}

3. Quadratic Time - O(nÂ²)
A quadratic algorithm is when the runtime is proportional to the square of the input size, usually for algorithms with two nested loops.

Example: Bubble sort algorithm:


public class ArrayUtils {
    public static void bubbleSort(int[] array) {
        int n = array.length;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++) {
                if (array[j] > array[j + 1]) {
                    int temp = array[j];
                    array[j] = array[j + 1];
                    array[j + 1] = temp;
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

4. Logarithmic Time - O(log n)
A procedure is considered to have logarithmic time complexity when its running time grows logarithmically with the size of input, a frequent case among procedures that reduce the input by half at every step.

The below is an example of a binary search on an array with a sorted element:

public class ArrayUtils {
    public static int binarySearch(int[] array, int target) {
        int low = 0;
        int high = array.length - 1;
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = (low + high) / 2;
            if (array[mid] == target) {
                return mid;
            } else if (array[mid] < target) {
                low = mid + 1;
            } else {
                high = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return -1; // Target not found
    }
}

5. Exponential Time - O(2^n)
An algorithm is said to have exponential time complexity if the time taken by an algorithm doubles when there is one additional input element, typically when recursive algorithms decompose problems to attempt all possibilities.

Example: Recursive finding of Fibonacci numbers:

public class FibonacciUtils {
    public static int fibonacci(int n) {
        if (n <= 1) {
            return n;
        }
        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
    }
}
