1. Memory allocation:

Arrays have fixed memory locations while Linked lists are more dynamic and allow for memory expansion.

2. Performance
Arrays provide constant time access to elements since they are stored in contiguous memory, while Linked lists access elements from the head node and goes through elements on by one giving us linear time.

3. Insertion and Deletion Operations:

Insertion: Inserting an element requires shifting elements to accommodate the new element, which requires O(n) time complexity in the worst case (e.g., inserting at the front).
Deletion: Deleting an element requires shifting elements, which requires O(n) time complexity.
Linked Lists:
Insertion: Insertion of a new node can be done in O(1) time if you have a pointer to the insertion location (e.g., at the head or tail). But finding the insertion location can be O(n) if you need to search for it.
Deletion: Deletion of a node can also be done in O(1) time if you have a pointer to the node to remove but finding that node is O(n).
